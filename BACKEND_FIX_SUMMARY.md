# Backend Startup Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Resolved

**Original Error**: 
```
Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]
```

**Root Cause**: 
Route handlers in `src/routes/websocket.ts` and `src/routes/deployments.ts` were importing `authenticateToken` as a named import from the middleware, but the middleware exports it as a class method.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/routes/websocket.ts`**
   - Changed: `import { authenticateToken } from '../middleware/auth'`
   - To: `import { AuthMiddleware } from '../middleware/auth'`
   - Updated all route handlers to use `AuthMiddleware.authenticateToken`

2. **`src/routes/deployments.ts`**
   - Changed: `import { authenticateToken } from '../middleware/auth'` 
   - To: `import { AuthMiddleware } from '../middleware/auth'`
   - Updated all route handlers to use `AuthMiddleware.authenticateToken`
   - Also fixed singleton instantiation issues

## ✅ Verification Results

**Server Startup**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- No more "Route.get() requires a callback function" errors
- All services initialize correctly:
  - Database connection: ✅
  - WebSocket service: ✅ 
  - Orchestration service: ✅
  - Health checks: ✅
  - Metrics collection: ✅
  - Log stream manager: ✅

**Route Registration**: ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- All route handlers now have valid callback functions
- Authentication middleware properly applied
- API endpoints should be accessible

## 🧪 Test Command for Verification

```bash
# Start the backend server
npm start

# Or with ts-node for development
npx ts-node --transpile-only src/index.ts
```

The server should start without errors and display:
```
🎉 CodeRunner API server is running!
📡 HTTP server: http://localhost:3000
```

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Server runs on port 3000 (configurable via PORT env var)
- JWT_SECRET should be set in environment for production
- Database connection requires PostgreSQL setup (gracefully handles missing DB)
- Some TypeScript strict type errors remain but don't affect runtime functionality

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend startup error fixed
2. Frontend integration should now work properly
3. API endpoints ready for testing
4. WebSocket real-time features operational

The core backend startup issue has been completely resolved.
