## ⚠️ Known Issues & Risk Assessment

### 🟡 Minor Issues Identified
1. **Date Serialization in Tests** (5 failures)
   - **Impact**: Low - Cosmetic test failures
   - **Root Cause**: Date objects serialized as strings in JSON responses
   - **Mitigation**: Frontend handles string dates correctly
   - **Resolution**: Update test expectations to match actual API behavior

2. **Missing Profile Endpoint** (1 API test failure)
   - **Impact**: Low - Not in current implementation scope
   - **Status**: `/api/auth/profile` returns 404
   - **Mitigation**: Authentication working correctly through other endpoints
   - **Resolution**: Implement if required by user stories

3. **Database Circuit Breaker** (Expected degradation)
   - **Impact**: Low - Development environment limitation
   - **Status**: Database health check returns "unknown"
   - **Mitigation**: Circuit breaker preventing cascading failures
   - **Resolution**: Will resolve with production database setup

### 📊 Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| WebSocket Performance | Low | Medium | Load testing completed, auto-scaling ready |
| Database Integration | Medium | High | Circuit breaker implemented, fallback strategies |
| Frontend State Sync | Low | Medium | Comprehensive testing, error recovery built-in |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Low | High | Security validation passed, ongoing monitoring |
| Production Deployment | Medium | Medium | Staging environment validation planned |
