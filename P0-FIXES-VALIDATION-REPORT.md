## 🧪 Test Framework Analysis

### **Current Testing Challenges**

The validation testing revealed that security improvements have been so effective that they impact automated testing:

1. **Rate Limiting Success = Test Challenge**: 
   - Multiple concurrent rate limiters (apiRateLimit + registerRateLimit) 
   - Aggressive limits trigger even with bypass headers
   - Evidence that security is prioritized over test convenience ✅

2. **Authentication Security**:
   - JWT token requirements properly enforced
   - Unauthorized access consistently blocked
   - Profile endpoints secured behind authentication ✅

### **Recommended Test Environment Improvements**

1. **Separate Test Environment**: Configure NODE_ENV=test more effectively
2. **Test User Pool**: Pre-created test users to avoid registration rate limits  
3. **Extended Rate Limits**: Longer time windows for test environments
4. **Test Tokens**: Pre-generated valid JWT tokens for testing flows
