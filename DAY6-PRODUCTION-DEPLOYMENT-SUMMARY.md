- Automatic service restart on failures
- Response time monitoring (<5s threshold)

✅ **System Monitoring**
- Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, disk)
- SSL certificate expiry monitoring
- Database connection monitoring
- Log aggregation and rotation

✅ **Backup & Recovery**
- Automated daily database backups
- Backup encryption and compression
- 30-day retention policy

---

## 🧪 Validation Results

### ✅ Pre-flight Check Results
```bash
./scripts/prod-preflight.sh
```

**Status**: 🟢 **Passing** (with expected development environment warnings)

**Key Validations**:
- ✅ Node.js compatibility (18+)
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ SSL certificate setup
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Docker configuration valid
- ✅ Security headers configured

- Database connectivity verified
- All systems operational

### ✅ SSL Certificate Demo
```bash
./scripts/ssl-setup.sh localhost --self-signed
```

**Result**: ✅ **SSL certificates generated and validated**
- Certificate: `ssl/coderunner.crt`
- Private key: `ssl/coderunner.key`
- Validation: Certificate valid for 365 days

## 🚀 Production Deployment Process

### Quick Start (3 Commands)
```bash
# 1. Validate readiness
./scripts/prod-preflight.sh

# 2. Setup SSL certificates
./scripts/ssl-setup.sh yourdomain.com --letsencrypt

# 3. Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

### Full Production Setup
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure `.env.production` with secure secrets
2. **SSL Certificates**: Generate production certificates with Let's Encrypt
