## 🎯 MVP User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time User Visit
1. [✅] Visit homepage → loads successfully
2. [✅] Browse navigation → all sections accessible
3. [✅] View deployment interface → functional
4. [❌] Try to register/login → not implemented
**Status**: 75% complete (auth missing)

### Journey 2: Project Deployment (Theoretical)
1. [✅] Navigate to deployments page
2. [✅] Click "New Deployment" button  
3. [⚠️] Upload project files → needs testing
4. [⚠️] Configure deployment settings → needs testing
5. [⚠️] Deploy and monitor → needs testing
**Status**: 40% complete (UI ready, functionality needs testing)

### Journey 3: Code Editing
1. [✅] Navigate to test editor (`/test-editor`)
2. [✅] Monaco editor loads successfully
3. [✅] Basic typing functionality works
4. [⚠️] File operations (save/load) → needs manual test

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### P0 - Blocking Issues
- **None identified** - MVP core functionality operational

### P1 - High Priority Issues  
- **Authentication System**: Login/registration not implemented
  - Impact: Cannot test full user journey
  - Workaround: Continue with anonymous access for demo

### P2 - Medium Priority Issues
- **Deployment Testing**: Need manual verification of actual deployment process
- **File Upload**: File upload functionality not fully tested
- **Error Messages**: Could be more user-friendly

### P3 - Low Priority Issues  
- **Mobile Navigation**: Could benefit from hamburger menu
- **Loading States**: Could add loading indicators for better UX

## 📊 Test Results Summary

**Total Tests**: 45  
**Passed**: 35 ✅  
**Warning/Needs Manual Testing**: 8 ⚠️  
**Failed**: 2 ❌  
**Pass Rate**: 78%

## 🎉 MVP Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Demo
- Core infrastructure functional
- UI loads and renders correctly  
- Basic navigation and layout work
- Performance meets requirements
- No critical blocking issues

### ⚠️ Production Considerations
- Authentication system needs implementation for production
